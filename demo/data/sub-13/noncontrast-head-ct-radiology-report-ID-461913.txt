Findings: Compared to most recent head CT, there is interval increase in the size of the left frontotemporoparietal subdural hematoma with a maximum thickness of this time of approximately 1.3 centimeters. Slight increase subarachnoid hemorrhage, particularly in the left sylvian fissure inferior frontal lobes, tentorium, suprasellar cistern and around the brainstem with further increased mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and increased left to right midline shift. Further effacement of the cortical sulci. Left right midline shift measures 1.4 centimeters. Increased density of the left temporal lobe hematoma with multiple bone fragments embedded within the brain parenchyma. Suspicion for an associated epidural hematoma. Decreased pneumocephalus. Early entrapment of the right lateral ventricle. New right frontal ventriculostomy catheter with tip in the left internal capsule. Intracranial pressure monitor is seen to extend into the interhemispheric fissure. Numerous facial bone and skull fractures are demonstrated. Hemorrhage in the paranasal sinuses. Impression: Interval increase in the size of the left cerebral convexity subdural hematoma with increased mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and increased left to right midline shift resulting in early entrapment of the right lateral ventricle. Overall stable parenchymal hematoma in the left temporal lobe with slight increase density of the hemorrhagic blood products. Decreased pneumocephalus. Suggestion of an associated epidural hematoma in the left middle crania fossa, more conspicuous than on previous exam. Scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage, slightly increased when compared to previous. Further decrease in size of the basilar cisterns suggesting increased brain swelling and mass effect..
