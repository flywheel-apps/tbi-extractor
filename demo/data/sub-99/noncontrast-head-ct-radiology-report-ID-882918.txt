Findings: Bilateral acute subdural hematomas right greater than left and bifrontal scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage. Scattered petechial subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe.. There is effacement of the right lateral ventricle and small degree of Central midline shift approximately 6 mm. The basal cisterns are markedly effaced and there is likely transtentorial herniation. Diffuse loss of gray-white matter differentiation and diffuse effacement of the basilar cisterns. Findings suggest diffuse cerebral edema. There is a small outer table fracture of the right frontal bone seen on the coronal views (series 207, image 21. There is a fracture of the nasal septum and possibly the medial wall of the left maxillary sinus. Layering debris in the maxillary sinuses and mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells. The sphenoid sinus and mastoid air cells are clear. Impression: 1. Bilateral acute traumatic subdural hemorrhage, with scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left frontal and temporal lobes anteriorly. There is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle causing 6 mm of midline shift and effacement of the basal cisterns and the suprasellar cistern. Suggestion of bilateral uncal herniation. Diffuse loss of gray-white differentiation. Findings suggest diffuse cerebral edema. 2. Blood along the interhemispheric fissure. Effacement of the basilar cisterns. 3. Small outer table bony avulsion of the right frontal bone. 4. Fracture of the nasal septum and possible fracture of the medial wall of the left maxillary sinus.
