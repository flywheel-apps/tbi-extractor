Findings: There is hyperattenuation predominantly involving the right sylvian fissure, left superior parietal sulci, right cingulate sulci and in the quadrigeminal cistern. There is layering hyperattenuation within the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle. There is layering hyperattenuation in the suprasellar cistern. Hyperattenuation is noted around the partially visualized spinal cord. Foci of parenchymal hemorrhages are noted in the inferior right temporal lobe, left frontal lobe and the right subthalamic nuclei. There is no significant midline shift. The bony calvarium and the bones of the skull base appear normal. The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are clear. No external soft tissue swelling. The orbits are unremarkable. There is a small amount of fluid in the right sphenoid sinus. Impression: 1. Multifocal subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above most notably in the right sylvian fissure and left superior parietal lobe. Hemorrhage is noted around the brainstem and cerebral convexities, right greater than left. Additional layering hemorrhage is noted in the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle, suprasellar cistern and superior vermian cistern. 2. Multifocal parenchymal hemorrhages, most notably in the right temporal lobe, left frontal lobe, and right subthalamic nuclei. Findings are consistent with severe shear injury.
