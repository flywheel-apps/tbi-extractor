Findings: There is no definite evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift or abnormal extraaxial fluid collection. There are numerous subtle punctate hyperdense foci scattered throughout the brain. The ventricles do not appear enlarged out of proportion to the cerebral sulci. Gray-white differentiation subtle a slightly decreased. There is subtle diffuse swelling of the brain. There are multiple skull base fractures and extensive facial fractures which will be more completely detailed on the accompanying facial bone CT reconstructions. There are mildly displaced bilateral frontal bone fractures through the anterior table of the frontal sinuses and nondisplaced fracture of the greater wing of the right sphenoid.. There are extensive sinus fractures with near complete opacification of the maxillary sinuses, ethmoid air cells, and sphenoid sinuses. There are a few scattered left ethmoid air cell opacities. Right ethmoid air cells are relatively clear.. There are multiple foci of subcutaneous emphysema and large dermal defects scattered throughout the frontal scalp and the soft tissues of the face with soft tissue edema. 

Impression: 1. No definite acute intracranial hemorrhage is identified. Several punctate densities could possibly represent early signs of hemorrhage, perhaps the earliest visual evidence for axonal injuries, but overall not definitive. 2. Suspicion for diffuse subtle edema of the brain without loss of all gray-white differentiation. This is a nonspecific finding that may represent the earliest indication of diffuse edema from trauma or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, or some combination HIE and traumatic edema. 3. Complex facial and skull base fractures will be more completely detailed on the accompanying facial bones CT.
