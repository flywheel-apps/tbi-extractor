Findings: Large lobar parenchymal hematoma in the left temporoparietal lobe extending inferomedially to involve the left basal ganglia, left, and upper left mid brain significant mass effect on the left lateral ventricle entrapment of the right lateral ventricle. There is minimal extension of hemorrhage into the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles. The hematoma measures approximately 9.9 cm in maximum AP diameter by 6.2 cm in width by 3.7 cm in height. It is surrounded by moderate amount of vasogenic edema and results in left trans uncal herniation. Additional infratentorial hemorrhage involving the mid and lower pons, extending slightly into the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles and into the left cerebellar hemisphere. Mass effect on the cerebellum results in low lying position of the cerebellar consult. Hemorrhage extends into the 4th ventricle. Overall diffuse effacement of the cortical sulci and effacement of the basal cisterns. Hyperostosis frontalis interna.. The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are clear. Impression: Large left temporoparietal lobar parenchymal hematoma with significant mass effect and midline shift resulting in left trans uncal herniation and right ventricular entrapment. Additional hemorrhage in the pons with extension into the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, left cerebellar hemisphere and extension of hemorrhage into the 4th ventricle. The pontine hemorrhage could represent a large Duret hemorrhage. Diffuse brain swelling with diffuse effacement of the cortical sulci and effacement of the basal cisterns. Critical results discussed with the pit boss at the time of the stab.
