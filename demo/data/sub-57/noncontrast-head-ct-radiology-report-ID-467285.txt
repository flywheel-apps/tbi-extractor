Findings: Diffuse loss of gray-white differentiation with complete effacement of the cortical sulci and basilar cisterns. Hyperdensity within the dural sinuses. Small ventricles. Suggestion of trans-uncal and transtentorial herniation with low lying cerebellar tonsils which are seen down to the level of the C1 vertebrae. Constellation of findings suggest a severe anoxic brain injury. Imaging findings correlate with possible brain death.. The bony calvarium and the bones of the skull base appear normal. Review of visualized dentition does not reveal significant periapical dental disease. The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses demonstrate air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses and right maxillary sinus. Diffusely coastal thickening in the paranasal sinuses with additional dependent debris in the right frontal sinus. Mastoid air cells are clear. Globes appear intact Impression: Diffuse loss of gray-white differentiation, effacement of cortical sulci and basilar cisterns and hyperdensity of the intracranial dural sinuses. Constellation of findings suggest a severe anoxic brain injury and possible brain death. HCMC Radiology offers CT scanning with the latest innovations, including personalized dose modulation, iterative and model-based reconstructions, and spectral CT, all of which work to reduce radiation dose to "as low as reasonably achievable", and afford significant reductions in contrast media dose.
