Findings: There is a large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring approximately 8.0 x 3.0 x 6.0 cm, previously 8.2 x 3.1 x 5.6 cm. Hemorrhage has intraventricular extension with blood noted in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, third ventricle, suprasellar cistern, and fourth ventricle. Additional subarachnoid blood is present over the anterior frontal and temporal lobes bilaterally. There is associated rightward midline shift of approximately 8 mm at the level of the lateral ventricles, previously 10 mm. There is mild to moderate surrounding edema, not significantly changed from previous CT. Hemorrhage within the prepontine cistern is present. Perimesencephalic cistern is not well seen. Decreased volume of the suprasellar cistern. There mild right uncal herniation and subfalcine herniation. The left lateral ventricle is mildly enlarged, possibly secondary to trapping. The bony calvarium and the bones of the skull base appear normal. Review of visualized dentition does not reveal significant periapical dental disease. The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are clear. The orbits are unremarkable. A calcific density is noted in the superior right orbit. Impression: 1. There is stable appearance of a large right frontotemporal parenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the ventricular system. There is associated 8 mm of rightward midline shift, not significantly changed from previous. 2. Mild right uncal herniation and subfalcine herniation without change. 3. Mild enlargement of the left lateral ventricle, possibly secondary to trapping, also stable. 4. Subarachnoid hemorrhage present over the frontotemporal lobes, similar to previous CT.
