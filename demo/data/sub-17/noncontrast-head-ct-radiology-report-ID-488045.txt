Findings: There is a moderate-size intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe with subarachnoid extension into sellar and suprasellar and and basal cisterns. There is a subdural hematoma along the right tentorium and subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right CP angle. The ventricles do not appear enlarged out of proportion to the cerebral sulci. Gray-white differentiation is intact throughout both cerebral hemispheres. There is a leftward 4 mm midline shift at the level of septum pellucidum. There is mixed density fluid in the right maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, likely representing blood. The bony calvarium and the bones of the skull base appear normal. The mastoid air cells are clear. Soft tissue swelling and hematoma of the right temporal scalp. Impression: 1. Moderate-sized hyperdense intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe and subarachnoid hemorrhages in the sellar and suprasellar and basal cisterns and right CP angle. There is a small subdural hematoma along the right tentorium. 2. There is a leftward 4 mm midline shift at the level of septum pellucidum. 3. Soft tissue swelling and hematoma right temporal scalp. 4. Mixed hyperdense fluid in the paranasal sinuses likely representing hemorrhage.
