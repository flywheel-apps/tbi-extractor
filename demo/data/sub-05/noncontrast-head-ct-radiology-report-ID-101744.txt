Findings: Persistent mixed density, but predominantly hyperdense, subdural hematoma along the right cerebral convexity, which measures approximately 15-16 mm thickness, minimally changed compared to the prior exam, when measured in a similar fashion. There is significant associated mass effect with persistent 13-14 mm of right left midline shift at the foramen of Monro. Subfalcine and uncal herniation with complete effacement of the right basal cisterns. There is some hemorrhage within the cranial aspect of the pons. There is mild asymmetric prominence of the left lateral ventricle which could possibly representing developing entrapment. No convincing acute gray-white matter differentiation loss. Scattered mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses, nonspecific in the presence of endotracheal and oroenteric tubes, which are visualized on the scout topogram; the scout topogram is otherwise noncontributory. The mastoid air cells appear clear. The calvaria and bones of the skull base appear normal. The orbits appear unremarkable. Atherosclerotic calcification of the carotid siphons. Impression: 1. Acute subdural hematoma along the right cerebral convexity which results in significant midline shift and subfalcine and uncal herniation, similar to the earlier exam. No convincing change in size/extent of some hemorrhage in the pons, which may represent a "Duret" hemorrhage related to mass effect upon the brainstem. 2. Asymmetric prominence of the left lateral ventricle, which could represent developing entrapment. According to a neurosurgery progress note in the patient's chart from 1330 hours, these findings are known based on the outside hospital imaging.
