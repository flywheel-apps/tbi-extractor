Findings: There is a large fluid collection along the left cerebral convexity with mixed hypo and hyperdensity measuring 3 cm in maximum thickness with significant mass effect as left-to-right subfalcine midline shift measuring approximately 20 mm and associated effacement of left sided perimesencephalic cistern. There is also diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage involving left cerebral convexity sulci as well as scattered right cerebral convexity subarachnoid hemorrhages. Gray to white matter differentiation is grossly preserved. There is marked dilatation of right temporal lobe suggestive of entrapment. There is fracture extending from right occipital bone into the right condyle, lateral clivus and superiorly to the base of the sphenoid sinus. There is also fracture in the squamous portion of the right temporal bone at the junction with the mastoid air cells with fluid within superior mastoid air cells. There is layering blood within the sphenoid and the right maxillary sinuses as well as small blood in the left maxillary sinus. Small foci of pneumocephalus posterior to the right small wing of the sphenoid and posterior to the clinoid process. Impression: 1. Very large left-sided subdural hematoma of mixed density suggesting active hemorrhage. Hematoma is causing significant compression of the left cerebral convexity, producing severe subfalcine herniation and transtentorial herniation and left uncal herniation. 2. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhages involving left cerebral convexity sulci lesser so scattered along the right cerebral convexity. 3. Multiple skull fractures involving right occipital bone, clivus, base of sphenoid sinus, possible posterior right maxillary sinus, and squamous portion of right temporal bone. 4. Fluid within right mastoid air cells most likely from fracture of the squamous portion of right temporal bone. Also layering blood within sphenoid sinus and right maxillary sinus.
