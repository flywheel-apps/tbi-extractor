## TBI Extractor Demo

This project provides an overview of the tbiExtractor gear, algorithm, and potential use cases.

### About tbiExtractor

tbiExtractor, extends pyConTextNLP, a regular expression algorithm using negation detection and contextual features, to create a framework for extracting TBI common data elements from radiology reports. The algorithm inputs a radiology report and outputs a structured summary containing 27 clinical findings with their respective annotations.

The default set of clinical findings (i.e., lexical targets):

* Annotation options: present, suspected, indeterminate, or absent (default).

	- aneurysm
	- anoxic
	- atrophy
	- contusion
	- diffuse_axonal
	- epidural_hemorrhage
	- facial_fracture
	- fluid
	- hemorrhage
	- herniation
	- hydrocephalus
	- hyperdensities
	- hypodensities
	- intracranial_pathology
	- intraparenchymal_hemorrage
	- intraventricular_hemorrhage
	- ischemia
	- mass_effect
	- microhemorrhage
	- midline_shift
	- pneumocephalus
	- skull_fracture
	- subarachnoid_hemorrhage
	- subdural_hemorrhage
	- swelling


* Annotation options: abnormal or normal (default).

	- cistern
	- gray_white_differentiation
